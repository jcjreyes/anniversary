        eleventh month, and classes started.<br />
        i could see you more often, and i felt happy<br />
        the only thing i looked forward to was seeing you<br />
        smiling so hard that it almost hurt<br /><br />

        it still didn't feel real, from an ldr<br />
        to the way that things went as they are:<br />
        meeting every day, hugging every day<br />
        and i appreciate every single time we do.<br /><br />

        from coco, to starbucks, to arete,<br />
        to tetsuo, to subway, to blue,<br />
        to the condo, to my condo, to meeting my dog<br />
        in a month, such a lot has occurred.<br /><br />

        and further on, i hope to spend more months like these with you.<br />
