        eighth month, and we were approaching closer to a year.<br />
        the closer it got, the more elated i felt.<br />
        just the simple nights with you,<br />
        browsing through cat groups or playing overcooked.<br /><br />

        they were all sweet, wonderful memories i keep dear.<br />
