        third month, and i sent you my sweater.<br />
        i loved your reaction as you received it<br />
        the excitement was so much, i almost couldn't handle it<br />
        it'll be yours to keep, especially for gloomy weather.<br /><br />

        i was so overjoyed, that<br />
        i wanted to kiss you, i wanted to hold you<br />
        little did i know, the following month<br />
        i would be able to lean on you.<br />
        i would be able to hold your hand.<br /><br />

        i would be able to hug you.
