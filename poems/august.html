        first month, and i didn't know what to expect<br />
        as we grew even closer, my love got stronger<br />
        you had it all, and you were perfect!<br />
        truly, meeting you made my life better.<br /><br />

        i remember, you showed me your hair!<br />
        and i'm sure it was evident... i wasn't aware<br />

        "IS THAT IT"<br />
        "LIKE"<br />
        "LITERALLY IT"<br /><br />

        one of my greatest slip-ups, that's for sure<br />
        but there's another one, and that memory's core<br />
        in the night we were on call and i was falling asleep<br />
        unintentionally, i said "i love you."<br /><br />

        there i just knew, our relationship was to keep<br />
