        fifth month, and it was your birthday.<br /><br />

        i remember your reaction to the bracelet,<br />
        as you unboxed it in front of me, eyes excited<br />
        felt very flustered as you wore it every single day<br />
        and even now you continue to wear both!<br /><br />

        i remember your christmas gift, a drawing of luna.<br />
        i remember your cookies,<br />
        as my cousins grew to discover who it came from.<br />
        they were the most delicious, and even my mom loved them.<br /><br />

        i remember ending the year with you, and i realized that it was<br />
        the start of what would be the best years of my life.<br />
