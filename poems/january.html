        i<br /><br />

        sixth month, and you would get a new cat.<br />
        at first, your mom didn't want her...<br />
        treated her almost like litter<br />
        but overtime, it did get better<br />
        and i just saw how good at loving you were.<br /><br />

        ii<br /><br />

        sixth month, and it was my birthday.<br />
        it came early, i remembered.<br />
        "wait, don't open it yet," you ordered.<br />
        i would see for myself later,<br /><br />

        that what you got for me was to be my most prized possession.<br /><br />

        a cassette tape... and a player<br />
        my heart was racing. my eyes were blurring.<br />
        "you make my world bubble up"<br />
        and my emotions... built up.<br /><br />

        the most wonderful gift that i've ever gotten<br />
        in all my years of living<br />
        there is nothing to compare, because you had set the bar.<br />
        it included a poem, and it remains close to my heart.<br /><br />

        because as you said:<br />
        "for an eternity or as long as i'm here,"<br />
        "your love will be safe with me."<br />
        with you, i am safe.
