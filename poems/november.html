        i<br /><br />

        fourth month, and you were in the beach.<br />
        a bit unbearable starting it without you:<br />
        but with no signal, it was out of your control.<br />
        and then at some point, you sent me your pics!<br />
        i couldn't believe it:<br />
        i had the most beautiful girlfriend in the world.<br /><br />

        ii<br /><br />

        fourth month, and we were excited.<br />
        my heart was pumping, my hands were shaking.<br />
        there were so many doubts in my mind:<br />
        how would i introduce myself?<br />
        what would you think of how i look like?<br />
        do i shake hands? what do i say?<br /><br />

        looking back every now and then, waiting for you to come<br />
        i have to admit, my nerves were at their peak<br />
        red cheeks, eyes fatigued, knees weak.<br />
        and in a moment, i looked back, almost meek<br /><br />

        it was you. yellow top, white jacket, jeans.<br />
        at this time of writing, i didn't even look at the picture.<br />
        i remember it clearly. vivid in my mind.<br />

        there was no second thought, i just hugged you<br />
        a sense of relief as you hugged me back.<br />
        if i could replay a memory forever,<br />
        that is what i would choose.<br />
