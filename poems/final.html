        a year<br /><br />

        you are my safe space<br />
        you remind me of a field of flowers<br />
        you remind me of the beautiful blue ocean<br />
        you remind me of a long, cozy road trip at night<br />
        you remind me how nice it is<br />
        to love, and be loved.<br /><br />

        our relationship is an eventful one,<br />
        and looking back, it's funny to trace the circumstances<br />
        on how we met. such an unlikely series of events<br />
        led me to you.<br /><br />

        i was sick in june, bored out of my mind.<br />
        i never bothered to meet new people, and thought i could wing it<br />
        once classes started. i don't know why, but pressing that link<br />
        joining calls, meeting new people, meeting you<br /><br />

        it was the most wonderful, unplanned event of my life.<br /><br />

        in a small amount of time, i discovered so many things<br />
        thanks to our relationship, thanks to you!<br />
        it was a year of excitement, of new experiences<br />
        a year of yearning, to meet my beloved<br />
        a year of fun, of many games together<br />
        a year of learning, to understand you better<br /><br />

        and most of all, a year of love<br />
        a love very sweet,<br />
        a love grounded in trust,<br />
        a love physically far,<br />
        a love energizing,<br />
        a love giving strength<br /><br />

        thank you, des<br />
        for a year of us.<br /><br />

        love, Justin<br />
