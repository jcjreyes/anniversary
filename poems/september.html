        second month, and we were watching youth of may<br />
        do you remember that notion you made?<br />
        i've never felt so loved and cared for<br />
        until you came along and gave me your love so pure.<br />

        i was burning, and i was aching<br />
        what i desired most was to see you<br />
        you were and still are a blessing, a virtue<br />
        and for you, anything i would do.<br />
