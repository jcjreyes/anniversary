        tenth month, and i could meet you again.<br />
        there we were, back in uptc<br />
        and for the second time, i would now see<br />
        my perfect girlfriend, now with red hair<br />
        and just like the first time, i hugged you then and there<br />
        we met other friends too, it was so sweet, i swear<br />
        though it was no simple matter<br />
        i'm glad we could make the meetup work.<br /><br />

        tenth month, and you gave me my first kiss.<br />
        it was magical, it was fantastic<br />
        being able to hold you, with lips interlocked<br />
        a surreal experience that was hard to describe<br />
        like flying up into the blue sky, wind blowing at my face<br />
        i was living a dream that i had been wanting to chase.<br />
