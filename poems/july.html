            never would i have thought<br>
            that these feelings of mine<br>
            would be laid bare open<br>
            in a way so outspoken.<br><br>

            flirts exchanged back and forth<br>
            and sure, as corny as it were:<br>
            i took it as a hint; that maybe<br>
            i wasn't alone, and you felt the same way with me?<br><br>

            what an unlikely start<br>
            to something that would be more<br>
            i heard about a match;<br>
            and strongly, i just felt<br><br>

            i wouldn't let myself be quiet,<br>
            and that i'd go ahead:<br>
            i'd say it. i like you.<br>
            can we talk? can i say something?<br><br>

            and so we did, and that was the start<br>
            of our story.</br>
