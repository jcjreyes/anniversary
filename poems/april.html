        ninth month, and we were on call with friends<br />
        staying up until the sun rose, until the day's end<br />
        i felt happy as you grew closer with not only me<br />
        but also my buddies, and i was filled with glee<br /><br />

        from midnight to morning<br />
        with a lot of confirming<br />
        so many talks, planned future walks<br />
        without even having to look at the clock<br />
