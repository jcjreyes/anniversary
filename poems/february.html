        seventh month, and it was valentine's day.<br />
        i couldn't give you a conventional gift, you already know why.<br />
        i was down, but then i had an idea and suddenly felt spry!<br />
        i could give you flowers, and it wouldn't come from me.<br />

        and i coded you a website<br />
        i was overjoyed at your delight<br />
        as i poured my heart over it, from day until night.<br />
        it was all for you, and i'm glad it paid off.<br />
